Plan
----

1. [x] Finish the new syntax layer
2. [ ] Finish translating the interpreter to use condg
3. [ ] Port all the examples to the new syntax layer
4. [ ] Fix the semantics of now inside later conde. I know how, but there's some code to write.
5. [ ] ideally: wrote one more compile-goal macro to generate the dynamic version from the staged version
6. [ ] see if the examples still work well given the dynamic code generated by 5
7. [ ] maybe: make `partial-apply` more relational rather than functional, not generating code immediately
8. [ ] maybe: the order in which things happen at staging time affect how specialized the code will be. for example, in `condg` whether we take the fallback depends on when unification happens. basically, the fair conjunction problem affects how much specialization happens. re-order `condg`s running to a fixpoint.

Of these, steps 4 and 6 are the only risky or hard ones I think
