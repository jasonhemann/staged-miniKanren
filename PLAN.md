Plan
----

1. [ ] Finish the new syntax layer
2. [ ] Finish translating the interpreter to use condg
3. [ ] Port all the examples to the new syntax layer
4. [ ] Fix the semantics of now inside later conde. I know how, but there's some code to write.
5, [ ] ideally: wrote one more compile-goal macro to generate the dynamic version from the staged version
6. [ ] see if the examples still work well given the dynamic code generated by 5

Of these, steps 4 and 6 are the only risky or hard ones I think
