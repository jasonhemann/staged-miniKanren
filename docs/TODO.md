- [ ] Get rid of `stage?`.

- [ ] This example should produce an error instead of failing. Maybe.
```
    (run* (x y)
      (fresh (c1 c2)
        (later-scope (fresh () (== 5 x) (== 6 y)) c1)
        (later-scope (fresh () (== 5 y) (== 6 x)) c2)
        (later `(conde ,c1 ,c2))))
```
meant to be
```
    (run* (x y)
      (fresh (c1 c2)
        (later-scope (fresh () (l== 5 x) (l== 6 y)) c1)
        (later-scope (fresh () (l== 5 y) (l== 6 x)) c2)
        (later `(conde ,c1 ,c2))))
```


- [x] Understand why [this crufy case](https://github.com/namin/staged-miniKanren/commit/3bf251d748713f65334e635011948ce012bbd13f#diff-31c94764bb6feaa595931c5cfd6a0bbc3cbcd54382fe692366fe4b7f99451f02) is needed for staging microKanren.

- [ ] Expect that if you put a call back in the env it should behave like a call.

- [ ] Fix [`letrec` issues](letrec-issue.scm).

- [ ] Make the staged and unstaged interpreter cover exactly the same language.
   + [x] same primitives
   + [ ] add multiple letrec bindings to unstaged interpreter

- [x] Use a reify tag for quasi instead of ad-hoc knowledge for each construct.
      Then `l==` becomes `(later (== ,(reify a) ,(reify b)))`.

- [x] Investigate how/if unstaged evalo should reenter staged code.
      Share closure representation and calling convention.

- [x] Figure out why lambdas got demoted in synthesis
      because of the shared calling convention.
      Findings: No demotion, instead `list` got promoted because its closure in `initial-env` now had the right shape.

- [x] Remember constraints in the generated code.

- [x] Done only for staged cases.
      Refactor the application cases to be consolidated into one, and check the `varo rands` only once.

- [x] Use `gensym`s for `expand`/`unexpand` tags.

- [x] Moot. Also refactor `sym` to use `gensym`.

- [x] Refactor `sym` to use `unexpand` instead, since the code is so similar.

- [x] Find a test case that breaks the lack of expansion on the expr in the `u-eval-expo` `varo` case in the staged interpreter.
      Then add that `expand` call.

- [x] Collect and fix examples of divergence during code generation due to infinite answers, and non-determinism in general. In particular:

    + [x] lambda arglist position could generate all number of arguments.
    + [x] (Crudely.) Pattern matching.
    + [x] Define `ground-spineo` and use it instead of `varo` for `rands` case.
    + [x] Define `ground-paramso` for lambda parameter case.
          Need fully ground because we want `lookupo` to be deterministic.
    + [x] Non-determinism when hole in application position.
          See todo "non-determinism" test in tests.
    + [x] `letrec` (clauses, bindings, lambda formals).
    + [x] (Already done by app consolidation.) Variadic `and`.
    + [x] (Ditto.) Variadic `or`.
    + [x] Make `match` ground checking less crude.
          Scrutinies need to be ground.
          Spine of clause list needs to be ground.
    + [x] Fix the "non-determinism" test.
          Somehow, we're getting true divergence on application with two arguments and unground function.
          Was due to `prim-id` being a variable.
          Not true divergence, but n=10.

- [x] This example should not fail.
      It fails because of the `non-varo` on `prim-id` to solve the non-determinism above.
      It seems like there should be a cut to `dynamic` at the point where eval of `rator` doesn't constraint the `rator` value.
    + [x] This example already works.
```
(run-staged 1 (q)
 (staged-evalo `(,q (list 1 2)) 1)
 (l== q 'car))
```

- [ ] Shake the generator by sampling `u-eval-expo`.
    + [x] Develop basic system.
    + [x] Ground symbols to exercise lambdas.
    + [ ] Pull out parts and make then runtime-staged.
```
run-staged 1 ()
  (fresh (e a)
     (== e `(,a 5))
     (staged-evalo e 5)
     (l== a 'quote)))
;; from an evalo-unstaged answer of (quote 5) => 5
```

- [ ] Document bugs found thanks to shaker.
    + [x] `not-ground-paramso` was not deterministic, missing a `non-varo` constraint in the `else` clause.
    + [x] Processing constraints was cutting off constraints over 1 for `symbolo` and `numbero` due to a format misunderstanding.
    + [x] Specializing happened too early for lambda closures inside of variadic outer lambda because the rands are not yet evaluated.
           Solution: switch the order to be like non-variadic case. Reverted: not acceptable due to performance regression in benchmarks.
           Long-term solution: see below, consider doing reification at once at the end, even when latering scopes.
    + [x] `or` is poorly translated, leading to non-determinism.
          `(or '#f _.0)`.
    + [x] Over-done expansion in `symbol?` and other primitives.
          `(symbol? equal?)` should evaluate to `#f`.

- [x] Consider doing reification at once at the end, even when latering scopes.
      This would avoid specializing being order dependent.

- [x] Check all explicit `later`s in `staged-interp` and make sure unifications are properly expanded.

- [] Fix predicate primitives to consider nil and booleans in addition to symbol, number and pair.
      - Fix in original faster-mk full interp
      - [x] Fix in unstated-interp
      - [x] Fix in staged-interp.

- [x] Lifting in scope should probably preserve constraints.

- [x] Run proper benchmarks comparing staged and unstaged programs.
    + [x] Have basic benchmarks.
    + [x] Write script to generate TeX file.
    + [x] Convert more tests into benchmarks.
    + [x] Devise new benchmarks.

- [x] Examine the `eval-expo #f` for rator evaluation.
      Possible test: `(let ([f ,e]) (f 5))`.
      Also re-consider whether `stage?` should be `#t` when latering to `u-eval-expo` when `varo`.

- [ ] Debug last slow test of Will.

- [ ] Think about: Just as
      staging is partial evaluation with manual annotations instead of heuristics,
      relational staging is partial deduction with manual annotations instead of heuristics.

- [ ] @michaelballantyne will write a demo of syntactic later.

- [x] For showing off synthesis it would be interesting to have some examples that use really big ground contexts;
      lots of helpers, say.

- [ ] Revive `staged-regexp` application.

- [ ] Revive `fuzzing` application.

- [ ] Unify representation of letrec-bound procedures and lambda-bound ones.

- [ ] How can staged interpreter be as close as possible to unstaged interpreter?
      In particular, the `letrec` and `lambda` cases are different.
      For `letrec`, we might need tabling.

- [ ] Make `syn-hole` robust to multiple results in the generator,
      instead of sprinkling `non-varo`s.
      Might require systematic `run*` instead of `run 1` in generator.

- [ ] Consider whether refactoring of application cases should also be done for non-staged cases.
      In general, probably need to make the result of deferred closures dynamic.

- [ ] Consider low-level optimizations in the generated code like getting rid of unnecesarry structures in unification.

- [ ] Consider this example. There is a blow up of spurious results in the second stage.
      Furthermore, we get non-determinism, which doesn't mesh well with `run 1`.
      Consider the work on partial deduction to get ideas to alleviate these issues.
      Or maybe a construct `conj-do-cartesian-product`.
```
(define-relation (foo x y)
(conj
  (conde
    [(== x 1)
     (l== y 1)]
    [(== x 1)
     (l== y 2)]
    [(== x 2)
     (l== y 3)])
  (conde
    [(l== y 1)]
    [(l== y 2)]
    [(l== y 3)])))

(foo 1 z)
```

- [x] Devise a much more pleasant interface for running and staging than `gen`.
    + [x] `run-staged`.
    + [x] `run-staged` with multiple query variables.
    + [x] `run-staged*`.
    + [x] `defined-staged-relaion`.
        * ```(define-staged-relation (test e) (staged-evalo `(cons ,e '()) '(5)))```
        * it'd do the query ```(run 100 (e) (staged-evalo `(cons ,e '()) '(5)))```
        * you get back some answer for e, call it <ans>
        * then you compile to ```(define-relation (test e) (== e <ans>) <the-generated-code>)```
        * `gen` knew about the evaluator and its environment
        * `define-staged-relation` is not meant to know about that at all!
          deals with arbitrary staged-mk goals in its body
          knows nothing of evalo
    + [x] Convert some of the bench tests to use the new interface.

- [ ] Make `evalo` stage polymorphic so that it can be instantiated to `evalo-staged` or `evalo-unstaged` (`u-evalo`).

- [ ] Compose with pink.

- [ ] `absento` should be `later`.
  ```
  (run-staged 1 (val) (evalo-staged '(quote closure) val))
  running first stage
  Exception in gen: staging failed
  ```
